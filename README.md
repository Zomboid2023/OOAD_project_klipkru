# Blockchain based voting system:
      to execute:
            use g++ -Iinclude src/*.cpp main.cpp -o voting_app
//This code implements a simple blockchain-based voting system in C++.

# note1 
this code is basically simulating the blockchain in a bare sense: 
- no smart contracts are used.
- the code is not using any real blockchain technology.

# note2:
user authentication needs to be implemented.
this will need to be done in a password system.
candidates need to be voter. i think...
